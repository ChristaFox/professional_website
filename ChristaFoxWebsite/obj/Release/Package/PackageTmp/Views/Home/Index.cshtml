    <p class="lead">

    <p>I have a passion for people and design--whether it be the look of a website, photo, book, etc. I have worked in retail for over ten years, and assisting clients and meeting their needs and expectations is something I take pride in. I love teaching clients how to navigate through the new technologies that will make their lives simpler.</p>
    <p>I'm currently in my Senior year of my Bachelor's for Computer Science at Franklin University. There my breadth of lerarning has spanned from professionalism, to best practices, database, application, design, infastructure, wireframes, as well as working on a team.</p>

        <p>I've had a passion for photography and videography since I was allowed to use the devices. My sisters and I used to video "SNL skits" as a favorite pastime. Don't worry they were completely original; no copyright infringement here.</p>
        <p>Here is a few favorites.
